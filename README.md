CSC6301 Repository contains 2 java programs. The first program takes user input and stores them into a Linked List and the sorts the integers and prints the sorted integers. The second program is a maintenece on the first where instead of the user input being stored and stored in a linked list the integers are then stored and sorted in a stack and the sorted integers are printed.
Within each program there is all the necessary documentation on how the code is to be run via the terminal if the code is downloaded to your machine.
