# Week 4 Project: Sorted Linked List

## Description
This Java program reads a list of integers from standard input, stores them in a **LinkedList**, and sorts them in ascending order using Java’s **Collections Framework**.

## Features
- Uses **LinkedList** to store integers dynamically.
- **Reuses** Java’s built-in `Scanner` for input handling.
- Uses **Collections Framework** for efficient sorting.
- Implements **best practices** in software development.

## How to Compile and Run

### **Compilation**
```sh
javac SortedLinkedList.java
```
# Week 5 Project: Sorted Stack Program

## Description
This Java program reads a list of integers from standard input, stores them in a **Stack**, and sorts them in ascending order.  
It is a **maintenance update** from **Project #4**, adapting the previous **LinkedList** implementation to use a **Stack** while **reusing existing logic** rather than rewriting from scratch.

## Features
- Uses **Stack** to store integers instead of LinkedList.
- **Reuses** Java’s built-in `Scanner` for input handling.
- Uses **Collections Framework** for efficient sorting.
- **Follows best practices** in software maintenance and code reuse.

## How to Compile and Run

### **Compilation**
```sh
javac SortedStack.java
